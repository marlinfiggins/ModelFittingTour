# Introduction to model fitting

This repository holds files from a small workshop introducing scientists to different methods for model fitting in science.
Initially, this work was presented to the Bozic group at the University of Washington's Department of Applied Mathematics.

There are three main sections:
    - Curve fitting
    - Modeling with likelihood
    - Bayesian modeling

## TODO
- [ ] Expand types of models introduced
- [ ] Separate out data to be used for examples to streamline things
- [ ] Add references throughout for methods used
- [ ] Consider extending to larger workship
